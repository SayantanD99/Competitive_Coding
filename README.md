# Competitive_Coding

This repository contains few Programs which I have solved on HackerRank,HackerEarth,& CodeChef.

The Programs are not based on just a particular language, but I have mainly used Python, C and Java for working out the problems.

These Programs are just for mere Practice. The respective questions are given as comments in the program file.
